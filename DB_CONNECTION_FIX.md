# Database Connection Fix for SASL Authentication Issue

## Problem
The application is experiencing a SASL authentication error when connecting to Supabase:
```
SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FINAL-MESSAGE: server signature is missing
```

## Cause
This is a known compatibility issue between:
- Node.js pg driver versions
- Supabase's transaction pooler 
- SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication method

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Direct Connection (Recommended)
Switch from the transaction pooler to the direct connection:

1. In Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database
2. Copy the "Direct connection" string instead of "Transaction pooler"
3. The direct connection uses port 5432 instead of 6543
4. Format: `postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.[project].supabase.co:5432/postgres`

### Option 2: Disable Scheduler (Temporary Fix)
The application works fine except for the scheduled post processing. You can:
1. Use the app normally for manual posting
2. Disable automatic scheduling until database is fixed

### Option 3: Alternative Database Provider
Consider switching to:
- Railway PostgreSQL
- PlanetScale (MySQL)
- Neon Database
- AWS RDS

## Current Status
- Application runs successfully
- All features work except automatic post scheduling
- Manual operations (posts, analytics, accounts) function normally
- Error is contained and doesn't crash the application

## Recommendation
Use the direct connection option from Supabase as it bypasses the transaction pooler where the SASL issue occurs.
